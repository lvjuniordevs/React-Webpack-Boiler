This is a bare bones boiler plate using Webpack with React.

This assumes you have webpack and webpack-dev-server installed globally.


To install these use this command:


npm install -g webpack

npm install -g webpack-dev-server

if you get this error: 

Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'...please run as root/admin


add sudo to the front.
